# odin-recipes
Project 1 in Odin's Foundation Course

In the "Recipes" project I'll be creating a basic recipe website, the website will contain a homepage that will link to various local webpages that display recipes. This project does not use CSS as it is a starting point for me to apply fundamental HTML knowledge.
